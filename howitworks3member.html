      <h1>How It Works</h1>
	    
	  <h2>They key features of contract hire are:</h2>
	  <p1>1. Fixed monthly payments cover the rental of the vehicle (you can also include any maintenance options if required.)</p1>
	  <p1>2. The monthly rentals are calculated by taking into consideration things such as: the cost of the vehicle, the contract period, the anticipated residual value of the car, the mileage allowance per year (which is agreed by yourself before you enter the agreement), any additional options such as tow bars/paint options or maintenance packages.</p1>
	  <p1>3. You never own the vehicle whilst you are paying the monthly rentals. It remains the property of the finance company during the contract. This means you do not have to worry about any deprecating value.</p1>
	  
	  <h2>Step-by step guide to Contract Hiring a car</h2>
	  <h3>1. Choose your car</h3>
	  <p1>I recommend that you choose from the website\'s list of cheapest deals, as this contains my best value, most readily available models. Alternatively, I can find you a bespoke car or van, if you simply ask using my quote form.
PCP
I only select the cheapest deals, and I know I don\'t have the widest selection in the world (I don\'t want to waste your time with uncompetitive cars), but I usually list over 500 cars and vans. The primary difference between business and personal contract hire is just the VAT exclusion/inclusion in the price.</p1>
