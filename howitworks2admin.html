      <h1>How It Works</h1>
	  <h2>What are the three types of leases?</h2>
	  <p1>There are three types of leasing - finance leasing, operating leasing and contract hire.

However, when it comes to car leasing, we talk about Contract Hire.

Contract hire allows you to choose a new car every few years without the worrying of the value of the car declining or you having to sell it at the end of the agreed term. This is because you hand the car back at the end of the contract with no further obligations (assuming that is that you have stuck to the agreed terms of your lease such as your annual mileage limit and fair wear and tear usage.)</p1>
	
	  <h2>Some key benefits of contract hire</h2>
	  <p1>1. Low upfront Payments: Commence your lease with a minimal upfront rental cost from as little as 1 month upfront.</p1>
	  <p1><br>2. Stable Payments: Enjoy fixed rentals throughout the entire package.</p1>
	  <p1><br>3. Flexibility: Tailor terms to align with your financial needs and driving preferences, including variable contract durations and mileage terms.</p1>
	  <p1><br>4. Inclusive Services: Monthly rentals cover road tax (VED) and breakdown cover.</p1>
	  <p1><br>5. Optional Maintenance: Include vehicle maintenance in monthly fees to evenly spread the associated costs.</p1>
	  <p1><br>6. Worry-Free Return: When returning the vehicle at the agreement's end, there's no need to concern yourself with its depreciation or disposal.</p1>
