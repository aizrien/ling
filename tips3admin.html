	  <h2>I seem to spend my life telling people they are too late for good deal:</h2>
	  <p1>How to explain this without it seeming like the usual sales talk? ... I don't know, but I will try to make this clear... You know, you are not buying this car. Only renting it for (probably 1 or 2 or 3 years). You are not stuck with it forever. <br><br> So, you have no real risk. You are going to pay someone some money to run a car however you look at it. Then here is my tip; if you see damn good bargain, don't think too long, just jump<br><br>Physical stock is always limited, as cars cannot be made to appear by magic, there are only so many sat in corner of field. So be brave, grab a bargain and avoid me having to make phone calls to disappointed people who have left decision too late. Remember that you have to pass finance before I can reserve you a car, so allow time for that!</p>
