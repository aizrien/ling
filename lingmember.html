	  <p><em>I'm Ling, the owner of LINGsCARS, a leading car leasing provider in the UK. 
	  <br>Despite appearances, I'm proud to have more happy customers and supply more new cars than many other leasing companies combined.
	  Originally from Chengdu, China, I married Jon Valentine in 1997 in Helsinki. 
	  <br>Jon, who hails from Yorkshire, claims his surname has Scottish-Jewish roots, but I think he's just joking.
	  </br>
	  </br>I focus on providing new UK Contract Hire cars and vans through LINGsCARS, which is my full-time business. 
	  <br>In 2008 alone, I moved over Â£35,000,000 worth of brand new cars!</em>
