      <h1>How It Works</h1>
	  <h2>Overview of car leasing</h2>
	  <p1>Car leasing can be likened to renting a vehicle. When you rent a car for a short period, you pay a daily rate based on the car model and other factors. Similarly, with leasing, you pay a fixed monthly fee to use a new car for a specific period with an agreed mileage, returning it once the lease term concludes. Unlike buying, there's no option to purchase the vehicle; you simply return it, concluding the lease agreement.

Leasing is also known as personal contract hire (PCH) or business contract hire (BCH). Both terms essentially refer to whether an individual or a business is leasing a vehicle.

At LINGs we may also offer car leasing on pre registered or used cars. These work in the same was as leasing a brand new unregistered car.</p1>
	  <h2>How does car leasing work?</h2>
	  <p1> When you lease a car (typically a new car, although we may offer some pre registered or used cars) the cost of the contract is split up into equal monthly payments. The length of the contract varies depending on what you choose but typically goes from 18 months to 4 years. In most cases you will pay an initial payment is made in the first month which is then followed by fixed monthly payments for the remainder of the contract.

Lease deals are often presented as two numbers, such as '3+ 23.' This indicates an upfront payment equivalent to 3 months, followed by 23 consecutive monthly payments, resulting in a total contract duration of 24 months.

An example of this would be a car advertised as £400 including VAT per month on a 3+23 profile would mean the initial payment is £1,200 followed by 23 payments of £400.
