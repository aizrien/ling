	   <h3>2. Fill in an online proposal (paper form also available)</h3>
	   <p1>You can get a printable or online version of my proposal provided on the website. Because the proposal form contains so much information which you may have to look up, it is fully protected on a secure server and security certificate. If it\'s a paper form, I need it signed.
	   <h3>3. Send the proposal form to me</h3>
	   <p1>When you have made sure you have completed ALL the information on the proposal form, press the submit button (duh!) on the online form, or scan and email it. I may require from business customers a copy of your latest accounts or P&L and balance sheet for the benefit of the finance company (I will advise you of this, it depends on a number of factors such as credit scoring, number of years trading, etc). From private customers, maybe I need a recent gas/water/electric bill, or bank statement to prove address, to prevent identity fraud. You will always need a copy of your full UK Driving Licence, or passport.</p>
