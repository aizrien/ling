      <h1>Tips and Hints</h1>
	  <h2>Buying extras can be like burning money:</h2>
	  <p1>Most extras fitted onto cars don't seem to make difference to the resale price in 2-3 years. Metallic paint, leather and aircon actually do, but let's face it most cars I sell come with aircon and met paint, anyway. So, if you ask for quote to include extras, you can bet your life that it will mean you pay the whole cost of the extra thing, divided by the number of rentals.
      <br><br>Well, my view is that if you're going to pay for the extra in full, you might as well own it... so why not just go out and buy it seperately? You'll probably get it cheaper than from a dealer, you do not give dealer/manufacturer profit and you have more choice.
	  <br><br>If, for example, you buy a nice set of alloys or a GPS navigation unit etc, at the end of the contract you can whipping the extra off the car and whipping it on ebay to get money back! I am damn clever, eh? Or fitting it on your next new car!	</p>
