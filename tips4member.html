      <h1>Tips and Hints</h1>
	  <h2>Do you need additional Maintenance Contract? I say NO!</h2>
	  <p1>You see, most of my brand-new cars are on 2 or 3-year deals, so you should only need an oil and filter service (you won't need brake pads etc unless you drive like German idiot Schumacker). You just pay this service yourself, OK? Some service intervals (eg. Renault) now at 18,000 miles!<br><br>You can have this small service done at a cheap VAT registered garage (applies to all but VW/Audi group contracts), just use quality parts. Your car is fully covered by the manufacturer warranty (use franchise dealer for this, free), and you get manufacturer's AA/RAC type cover.<br><br>And when was the last time you had a puncture or needed a battery on a new car? So I don't think you need to pay more for "maintenance"! This is big profit area for other companies! Of course, they don't tell you that! However, if you really insist, I can add it to your car.</p>
