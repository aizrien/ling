      <h1>How It Works</h1>
	  <h2>Step-by step guide to Contract Hiring a car</h2>
	  <h3>6. Enjoy your car!</h3>
	  <p1>You need to insure your car, but anyone you choose can drive it. Treat it as you would treat your own personal car. You have full UK manufacturer\'s warranty and whatever breakdown cover the manufacturer applies. Usually, servicing is your own responsibility. With all the money you have saved, book yourself a nice expensive holiday, or buy a diamond ring!</p>
	  <h3>7. Prepare for, then return your car at end of contract</h3>
	  <p1>Simply, your car needs to be in a condition commensurate with its age and mileage. This is common sense. A useful guide wot I wrote (heh) is available in PDF format to read/print. You just hand the car back. It is collected directly from you at your address.</p>
