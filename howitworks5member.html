      <h1>How It Works</h1>
	  <h2>Step-by step guide to Contract Hiring a car</h2>
	  <h3>4. Wait for an order form, then sign it - at this stage you will commit to the car</h3>
	  <p1>When finance approval has been completed, I will email you an order form for your car. A signed order form commits you to ordering the car. Check it, print it, sign it, indicate your colour choice, then scan/email it back to me. I then confirm and order the car and confirm the lead time.</p>
	  <h3>5. Sign finance documents and wait for delivery of your car</h3>
	  <p1>Usually, I will post (for security reasons) documents to be signed before delivery of your car. These need to be completed and returned, swiftly, usually together with the initial payment. Occasionally, I will arrange delivery of your car with finance documents to be signed at the same time, but this is not typical. More proofs may be required. All this is to protect your identity. Delivery is free, usually to your home or work address, whichever is most convenient.</p1>
