	  <h2>Leasing company website price VAT scam trick;</h2>
	  <p1>It is so unfair to my private customers and to me, how many other UK Car Leasing companies illegally advertise and display prices on their websites, advertising and marketing. My local Trading Standards authority has been helping me with this massively unsatisfactory situation. When British consumers click onto most car leasing and contract hire sites, they are shown prices that are deliberately meant to deceive and confuse. The prices are deliberately meant to make cars appear cheaper than they really are (by showing them ex VAT).

According to Gateshead Trading Standards, The Pricing Practices Guide made under the "Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008" requires that:

<h3><i>'All price indications you give to consumers, by whatever means, should include VAT. This total price must be displayed prominently so that consumers can see it.

Prices may ONLY be indicated exclusive of VAT at an outlet or through advertisements from which ALL of your business is with business customers.'</i></h3>
