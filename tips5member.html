      <h1>Tips and Hints</h1>
	  <h2>Always make sure you check your car's mileage on delivery:</h2>
	  <p1>Sometimes new car will be delivered on a car transporter, other times it will be driven to you. Either way, I always ask you check mileage on delivery. Write mileage on delivery sheet (before signing!!!) and keep a copy.
	  <br><br>At the end of contract, you can then subtract these miles from any "excess mileage" you may have incurred (extra miles over contract amount). This is easy if you have kept a copy of the delivery note. This is hard if you have lost it.
	  <br><br>For example, if a car is driven to you and has 300 miles on the clock, even at very low figure of 5p per mile this is worth £15. At a high figure of 15p per mile, this is worth £45! It's like getting a free tank of expensive British fuel!</p>
